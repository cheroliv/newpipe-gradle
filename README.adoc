A Gradle project that uses the `com.cheroliv.newpipe` plugin to download
music from YouTube and convert it to MP3 — no Python required.

== Prerequisites

[cols="1,2,1", options="header"]
|===
| Tool | Role | Required

| JDK 24+
| Gradle and plugin runtime
| ✅

| Docker _or_ local FFmpeg
| Audio to MP3 conversion
| ✅ (one or the other)

| Docker
| Alternative to system FFmpeg
| ⬜ optional
|===

[NOTE]
====
No Python dependency is required.
`yt-dlp` is not used — YouTube extraction is handled by
https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor[NewPipe Extractor], pure JVM.
====

== Project Structure

[source,text]
----
newpipe-gradle/               <-- this repo (consumer project)
├── build.gradle.kts          <-- applies the plugin, nothing else
├── settings.gradle.kts       <-- declares JitPack in pluginManagement
├── musics.yml                <-- your music selection
├── gradle/
│   └── libs.versions.toml   <-- version catalog
└── newpipe-plugin/           <-- plugin source code (sub-project)
----

== Configuration

=== settings.gradle.kts

JitPack must be declared in `pluginManagement` because the plugin depends on
NewPipe Extractor, which is hosted on JitPack.

[source,kotlin]
----
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        gradlePluginPortal()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}

dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        mavenLocal()
        mavenCentral()
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
    }
}

plugins {
    id("org.gradle.toolchains.foojay-resolver-convention") version "1.0.0"
}

rootProject.name = "newpipe-plugin"
include("newpipe")
----

=== build.gradle.kts

[source,kotlin]
----
plugins {
    id("com.cheroliv.newpipe") version "1.0.0"
}

newpipe {
    configPath = file("musics.yml").absolutePath
}
----

=== musics.yml

The configuration file declares artists, their individual tracks and their
YouTube playlists.

[source,yaml]
----
artistes:
  - name: Daft Punk
    tunes:
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NV6Rdv1a3I
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAjR4_CbPpQ
    playlists:
      - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLx0sYbCqOb8TBPRdmBHs5Iftvv9TPboYG

  - name: Massive Attack
    tunes:
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u7K72X4eo_s
    playlists:
      - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dWeeUIZFgA&list=RDEMtbC_BXEtvKp9p_L81bzVwA&start_radio=1
----

==== YAML Structure

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
| Field | Description

| `artistes`
| List of artists to download

| `artistes[].name`
| Artist name — used as the folder name under `downloads/`

| `artistes[].tunes`
| Individual YouTube URLs. The artist name comes from the `name` field.

| `artistes[].playlists`
| YouTube playlist URLs (standard or Mix Radio `list=RD...`).
The artist name comes from the YouTube video uploader tag.
|===

[NOTE]
====
*YouTube Mix Radio* (`list=RD...`, `list=RDEM...`, `list=RDAMVM...`) +
These playlists are dynamically generated. The plugin automatically fetches
the first page (~15 tracks) and stops — no infinite loop.
====

== Usage

=== Download the full selection

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew download
----

MP3s are organised as follows:

[source,text]
----
downloads/
├── Daft Punk/
│   ├── Daft Punk - Get Lucky.mp3
│   └── Daft Punk - Around the World.mp3
└── Massive Attack/
    └── Massive Attack - Teardrop.mp3
----

=== Download a single video (CLI)

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew download --url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NV6Rdv1a3I
----

With a custom output folder:

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew download \
  --url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NV6Rdv1a3I \
  --output=/home/user/Music
----

=== List available tasks

[source,bash]
----
./gradlew tasks --group=newpipe
----

== Behaviour

=== Concurrent downloads

The plugin downloads up to 3 videos simultaneously to maximise throughput
while avoiding YouTube throttling. As soon as a download completes, the MP3
conversion starts immediately — temporary files do not accumulate.

=== Duplicate detection

Before each download, the plugin checks whether an identical MP3 already
exists by comparing ID3 tags (title, artist) and audio duration (±2s tolerance).
If the file matches, it is skipped.

=== Resume after interruption

If the task is interrupted (Ctrl+C, network failure), temporary files
(`_temp.m4a`) and incomplete MP3s are automatically deleted on the next run.
The download restarts cleanly from the beginning.

=== Missing playlists and videos

If a playlist or video no longer exists (deleted, private, invalid URL),
it is skipped with a warning in the logs. The rest of the selection continues
to be downloaded.

=== File naming

[source,text]
----
downloads/<Artist>/<Artist> - <Title>.mp3
----

If the YouTube title contains only special characters that cannot be used in
a file name, the raw YouTube title is kept with only filesystem-forbidden
characters replaced.

== ID3 Tags Written

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Tag | Value

| `TITLE`
| YouTube video title

| `ARTIST`
| Artist name (YAML for tunes, YouTube uploader for playlists)

| `ALBUM`
| `YouTube`

| `COVER`
| YouTube video thumbnail
|===

== Troubleshooting

=== The `download` task fails with "configPath not found"

Check that `musics.yml` exists at the project root and that the path in
`build.gradle.kts` is correct:

[source,kotlin]
----
newpipe {
    configPath = file("musics.yml").absolutePath  // absolute path required
}
----

=== Downloads are very slow

YouTube throttles unofficial clients. This behaviour is tied to the version
of NewPipe Extractor in use. To point to the latest `dev` branch commit:

[source,toml]
----
# gradle/libs.versions.toml
[versions]
newpipe-extractor = "abc1234567"  # hash of the latest dev commit
# https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor/commits/dev
----

=== FFmpeg not found

[source,bash]
----
# Debian / Ubuntu
sudo apt install ffmpeg

# macOS
brew install ffmpeg

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S ffmpeg
----
